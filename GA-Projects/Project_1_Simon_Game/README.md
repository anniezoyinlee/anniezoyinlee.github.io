>  Simon Game

## Project Description
>  My game app is called Simon. It's a game for testing memory. When the game starts the program creates a sequence of different colors at random and the user should repeat the sequence. The program should go next round if the player is successful. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over.
